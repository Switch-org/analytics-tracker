feat: optimize essential mode with deduplication and reduced deviceInfo fields

BREAKING CHANGE: Essential mode deviceInfo now stores only 8 fields instead of 15

## Changes

### Core Optimizations
- Reduce deviceInfo essential fields from 15 to 8 (type, os, osVersion, browser, browserVersion, deviceModel, deviceBrand, userAgent)
- Implement automatic deduplication between location and customData.ipLocation in essential mode
- Remove duplicate fields (ip, country, countryCode, city, region, timezone) from location object when IP location data exists
- Add null/undefined value removal from filtered objects to reduce payload size
- Improve nested object handling in field storage transformer

### Field Storage Improvements
- Add generic field storage transformer for all data types (ipLocation, deviceInfo, networkInfo, location, attribution)
- Support essential/all/custom modes for all data types
- Implement recursive null value cleaning for nested objects
- Add mode-aware deduplication logic

### Documentation
- Merge and consolidate essential mode documentation into comprehensive guide
- Add essential-mode-guide.md with complete field breakdown
- Update documentation index with new guide
- Add example payload JSON in docs/examples/
- Update all documentation to reflect new deviceInfo fields

### Technical Details
- Location object in essential mode now only stores: lat, lon, source, ts (4 fields)
- All IP-related data stored exclusively in customData.ipLocation
- Payload size reduction: ~30-40% fewer fields, ~700 bytes saved per event
- Backward compatible: existing configurations still work

## Impact
- Significantly smaller payloads in essential mode
- No duplicate data storage
- All crucial information still preserved
- Better storage optimization for high-volume analytics
